# InvestiSmart
This repository contains the code for the frontend of my InvestiSmart web app. Coded from scratch using React and Node.js

## The Aim
Created as a way for me to gain experience working with intuitive user interfaces and to help me learn Web Application security better in a Fintech environment.

## What happened
The project was stopped during security upgrades due to pressure on time caused by Uni and job applications. If I were to continue this project and put it live security would be the first thing addressed, and I know exactly where and how I would improve security.
Overall I have learnt loads about the SDLC, the need for planning and rapidly building a product.
