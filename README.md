# InvestiSmart
This repository contains the code for the frontend of my InvestiSmart web app. Coded from scratch using React and Node.js

## The Aim
Created as a way for me to gain experience working with intuitive user interfaces and to help me learn Web Application security better in a Fintech environment.

## What happened
The project was stopeed as I lost heart in the profitability of the idea and I realised I made some concept and design errors early on due to poor planning and lack of experience.
Since it has only been used in a dev environment, security has only been partially attended to. However if I were to continue this project and put it live, that would be my first course of action, and I know exactly where and how I would fix said security issues.
Overall I have learnt loads about the SDLC, the need for planning and a pinch of entrepreneurship too.
